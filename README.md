**A LiveView-powered BI interface that mounts directly in your Phoenix app — SQL editor, dashboards, charts, and AI-powered query generation in plain English. No separate deployment needed.**

[Try the live demo](https://lotus.typhoon.works/)

<!-- TODO: Replace with a 30-second demo GIF showing: mount in router → open browser → write SQL → see chart → save to dashboard -->

## Why Lotus Web?

You shouldn't need to deploy Metabase or Redash just to query your database. Lotus Web gives your team a full BI interface inside your existing Phoenix app — one dependency, one route, done. It shares your app's authentication, runs on your existing infrastructure, and is read-only by design.

We're running Lotus Web in production at [Accomplish](https://accomplish.dev).

> While Lotus Web already has a solid feature set and its API surface is stabilizing, it's still evolving. We'll make a best effort to announce breaking changes, but we can't guarantee full backwards compatibility yet.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add dependencies

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:lotus, "~> 0.13.0"},
    {:lotus_web, "~> 0.12.0"}
  ]
end
```

### 2. Configure Lotus

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :lotus,
  ecto_repo: MyApp.Repo,
  default_repo: "main",
  data_repos: %{
    "main" => MyApp.Repo
  }
```

### 3. Run the migration

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration create_lotus_tables
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateLotusTables do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up, do: Lotus.Migrations.up()
  def down, do: Lotus.Migrations.down()
end
```

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

### 4. Mount in your router

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/router.ex
import Lotus.Web.Router

scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

  lotus_dashboard "/lotus"
end
```

### 5. Visit `/lotus` in your browser

That's it. Full BI dashboard, running inside your Phoenix app.

## Features

### SQL Editor

Web-based SQL editor with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and real-time execution powered by LiveView. Switch between configured databases, run queries with Cmd/Ctrl+Enter, and see results instantly.

See the [getting started guide](guides/getting-started.md) for more.

### Schema Explorer

Browse your database tables, columns, and statistics interactively. Click to inspect table structures and understand your data before writing queries.

### Visualizations

Toggle between table and chart views for any query result. 5 chart types available: bar, line, area, scatter, and pie. Configure axes and color grouping, then save the visualization alongside the query.

Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+G (chart settings), Cmd/Ctrl+1 (table view), Cmd/Ctrl+2 (chart view).

See the [visualizations guide](guides/visualizations.md) for chart configuration details.

### Dashboards

Combine saved queries into interactive dashboards with a 12-column grid layout. Add query result cards, text (markdown), headings, and links. Configure auto-refresh intervals and share dashboards publicly via secure token URLs.

See the [dashboards guide](guides/dashboards.md) for layout and sharing details.

### Smart Variables and Widgets

Parameterize queries with `{{variable}}` syntax. Variables are automatically detected and rendered as input widgets. Supports text, number, and date types with configurable widgets — including dropdowns backed by static options or live SQL queries.

See the [variables and widgets guide](guides/variables-and-widgets.md) for advanced usage.

### AI Query Assistant

Ask your database questions in plain English. The AI assistant discovers your schema, respects table visibility rules, and supports multi-turn conversations for iterative refinement — no other embeddable BI tool does this. Bring your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini API key. Open it with Cmd/Ctrl+K.

See the [AI assistant guide](guides/ai-assistant.md) for setup and provider options.

### Multi-Database Support

Execute queries against any configured Ecto repository. Switch between databases from the editor toolbar — useful for apps with separate analytics, reporting, or multi-tenant databases.

## Configuration

### Mount Options

```elixir
# Default
lotus_dashboard "/lotus"

# Custom route name
lotus_dashboard "/admin/queries", as: :admin_queries

# Custom WebSocket settings
lotus_dashboard "/lotus",
  socket_path: "/live",
  transport: "websocket"

# Additional mount callbacks
lotus_dashboard "/lotus",
  on_mount: [MyAppWeb.RequireAdmin]

# Feature flags
lotus_dashboard "/lotus",
  features: [:timeout_options]
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:timeout_options` | Adds a per-query timeout selector (5s to 5m) to the editor toolbar |

### Caching (Optional, Recommended)

Add Lotus to your supervision tree and configure cache settings:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
children = [
  MyApp.Repo,
  Lotus,          # Enables caching
  MyAppWeb.Endpoint
]
```

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :lotus,
  cache: [
    adapter: Lotus.Cache.ETS,
    profiles: %{
      results: [ttl_ms: 60_000],
      schema: [ttl_ms: 3_600_000],
      options: [ttl_ms: 300_000]
    }
  ]
```

### Internationalization

Lotus Web ships with a dedicated Gettext backend. To set the locale, store it in the Phoenix session:

```elixir
defp persist_user_locale(conn, _opts) do
  user_locale = get_session(conn, :user_locale) || "en"
  put_session(conn, :lotus_locale, user_locale)
end
```

To contribute translations, submit a PR with updates to `priv/gettext/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/lotus.po`.

## Security

**Always mount behind authentication in production.** Lotus Web provides powerful query capabilities and should only be accessible to authorized users.

```elixir
# Always require authentication
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]
  lotus_dashboard "/lotus"
end
```

Additional security layers:

- **Read-only execution** — all queries run in read-only transactions via Lotus
- **Table visibility controls** — hide sensitive tables and columns from the interface
- **Session safety** — secured by LiveView architecture with automatic session state restoration
- **Export security** — CSV exports use short-lived, signed, encrypted tokens

Configure table visibility in Lotus:

```elixir
config :lotus,
  table_visibility: %{
    default: [
      allow: ["reports_users", "analytics_events"],
      deny: ["users", "admin_logs"]
    ]
  }
```
