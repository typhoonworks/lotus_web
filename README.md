**A beautiful, lightweight web interface for [Lotus](https://github.com/typhoonworks/lotus) - the SQL query runner and storage library for Elixir applications.**

LotusWeb provides a free, easy-to-setup BI dashboard that you can mount directly in your Phoenix application. Perfect for technical and non-technical users who need to run SQL queries, create reports, and explore data without the complexity of a full BI solution.

>üöß While LotusWeb already has a solid feature set and its API surface is stabilizing, it‚Äôs still evolving. We‚Äôll make a best effort to announce breaking changes, but we can‚Äôt guarantee backwards compatibility yet ‚Äî especially as Lotus broadens its `Source` abstraction to support more than SQL-backed data sources.

## Production Use and UUID Caveats

LotusWeb is generally safe to use in production. It relies on Lotus‚Äôs read-only execution and session safety. We are running it in [Accomplish](https://accomplish.dev) successfully in production today, notwithanding being affected by the limitation described below.

If your application uses UUIDs or mixed ID formats, there are current limitations that affect how variables work in the LotusWeb UI:

- Variable binding around UUID columns is constrained across different storage types and databases:
  - PostgreSQL `uuid`
  - MySQL `BINARY(16)` vs `CHAR(36|32)`
  - SQLite `TEXT` vs `BLOB`
- You can still get a lot of value from the UI, but filtering on UUID columns with `{{var}}` will likely not work in Postgres as it warrants a special binary format that is not UI friendly (we convert to String for the UI but currently have no way to cast it back with runtime column inference).

We plan to improve this with column‚Äëaware binding (Lotus will use schema metadata to deterministically cast/shape values). Once available, LotusWeb will take advantage of it automatically.

## Installation

Add `lotus_web` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lotus_web, "~> 0.5.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Requirements

- **Elixir 1.16+** and **OTP 25+**
- **Lotus 0.6+** - LotusWeb 0.3+ requires Lotus 0.6 or later
- **Phoenix 1.7+** for LiveView compatibility

### Version Compatibility Matrix

| LotusWeb Version | Required Lotus Version | Notes |
|------------------|------------------------|-------|
| 0.4.x            | 0.9.0+                | Latest stable release |
| 0.3.x            | 0.6.0+                | Legacy version |

> The dependency constraint in `mix.exs` automatically ensures compatible versions are installed together.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Configure Lotus (if not already done)

Add Lotus configuration to your `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :lotus,
  ecto_repo: MyApp.Repo,        # Where Lotus stores queries
  default_repo: "main",         # Default repository for query execution
  data_repos: %{                # Where queries execute
    "main" => MyApp.Repo,
    "analytics" => MyApp.AnalyticsRepo
  }
```

### 2. Add Lotus migration (if not already done)

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration create_lotus_tables
```

Add the Lotus migration to your generated migration file:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateLotusTables do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up do
    Lotus.Migrations.up()
  end

  def down do
    Lotus.Migrations.down()
  end
end
```

Run the migration:

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

### 3. Configure Caching (Optional but Recommended)

Lotus supports result caching to improve query performance. To enable caching:

#### Add Lotus to your supervision tree:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    MyApp.Repo,
    # Add Lotus for caching support
    Lotus,
    MyAppWeb.Endpoint
  ]

  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end
```

#### Configure cache settings:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :lotus,
  cache: [
    adapter: Lotus.Cache.ETS,
    namespace: "my_app_cache",
    profiles: %{
      results: [ttl_ms: 60_000],      # Cache query results for 1 minute
      schema: [ttl_ms: 3_600_000],    # Cache schemas for 1 hour
      options: [ttl_ms: 300_000]      # Cache dropdown options for 5 minutes
    }
  ]
```

**Note**: Without adding Lotus to your supervision tree, all query functions will work normally but caching will be disabled.

### 4. Mount LotusWeb in your router

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
  use MyAppWeb, :router
  import Lotus.Web.Router

  # ... other routes

  scope "/", MyAppWeb do
    pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user] # üîí Important: Add authentication!

    lotus_dashboard "/lotus"
  end
end
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice**: Always mount LotusWeb behind authentication in production. The dashboard provides powerful query capabilities and should only be accessible to authorized users.

## Usage

Once mounted, visit `/lotus` in your application to access the dashboard:

### **Query Editor**
- Write and execute SQL queries with syntax highlighting
- Switch between configured databases
- Real-time query execution
- Error handling with clear messages

### **Schema Explorer**
- Browse available tables and their columns
- View table statistics and schema information
- Click to insert table/column names into queries (coming soon)

### **Query Management**
- Save queries with descriptive names
- Edit and update existing queries
- Delete queries you no longer need

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

```elixir
# Mount with default options
lotus_dashboard "/lotus"
```

### Custom Route Name

```elixir
# Use a custom route name (default is :lotus_dashboard)
lotus_dashboard "/admin/queries", as: :admin_queries
```

### WebSocket Configuration

```elixir
# Customize WebSocket settings
lotus_dashboard "/lotus",
  socket_path: "/live",
  transport: "websocket"
```

### Additional Mount Callbacks

```elixir
# Add authentication or other mount logic
lotus_dashboard "/lotus",
  on_mount: [MyAppWeb.RequireAdmin, MyAppWeb.LogDashboardAccess]
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Always Require Authentication

```elixir
# ‚úÖ Good - requires authentication
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]
  lotus_dashboard "/lotus"
end

# ‚ùå Bad - no authentication required
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser]
  lotus_dashboard "/lotus"  # Anyone can access!
end
```

### 2. Use Table Visibility Controls

Configure Lotus to control access to database tables:

```elixir
config :lotus,
  table_visibility: %{
    default: [
      allow: [
        "reports_users",
        "analytics_events",
        {"reporting", ~r/^daily_/}  # Allow reporting.daily_* tables
      ],
      deny: [
        "users",           # Block sensitive user data
        "admin_logs",      # Block admin tables
        {"public", ~r/^schema_/}  # Block schema tables
      ]
    ]
  }
```
