# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Centralized chart colors in `VegaSpecBuilder`** - 15+ scattered hex literals (gauge/progress fills, delta indicators, waterfall bars, combo accent line, neutral labels, track backgrounds) are now consolidated into a single `@chart_colors` module attribute, exposed via `VegaSpecBuilder.chart_colors/0`, so a future theme/dark-mode pass only has to touch one place (#107)
- **Extracted duplicated AI action buttons in `AiAssistantComponent`** - The "Explain query" / "Optimize query" buttons were duplicated between the empty state and the input area with slightly different sizing; both now render via a shared `ai_action_buttons` function component that takes a `:size` (`:lg` or `:sm`) and a `:generating` flag (#109)
- **Use a dedicated salt for export tokens** - `ExportController` now passes `"lotus_export"` as the salt to `Phoenix.Token.encrypt/decrypt` instead of prefixing the full `secret_key_base`. This follows the Phoenix convention and lets the framework handle key derivation internally (#108)
- **Extracted duplicated data source resolution in `QueryEditorPage`** - The four AI-related event handlers (`send_ai_message`, `optimize_query`, `explain_query`, `explain_fragment`) each inlined the same fallback-to-default-repo logic; this is now a single `resolve_data_source/1` private helper (#106)
- **Consolidated `PublicDashboardLive` into `DashboardLive`** - Removed ~95% duplicated callbacks by unifying the two LiveViews. The `/public/:token` route now mounts `DashboardLive`, which resolves a `:public_dashboard` page via `resolve_page/1` and branches mount defaults on the existing `public_view` assign (#104)

### Security

- **XSS via unsanitized markdown rendering** - `AiAssistantComponent` and dashboard `CardComponent` piped Earmark output straight into `Phoenix.HTML.raw/1`, allowing `<script>` tags, inline event handlers, and `javascript:` URLs to execute in the browser. Rendered markdown is now scrubbed via `HtmlSanitizeEx.markdown_html/1` through the new `Lotus.Web.Markdown.to_safe_html/1` helper
- **Content-Disposition header injection via unsanitized filename** - `ExportController` interpolated the token-supplied `filename` directly into the `Content-Disposition` header. Filenames are now sanitized to strip double quotes, backslashes, and control characters (including `\r`/`\n`), preventing HTTP response header injection as a defense-in-depth measure
- **LiveView process crash via crafted WebSocket events** - Replaced `String.to_existing_atom/1` on client-supplied values across LiveView event handlers with explicit allowlists. Affected handlers: `QueriesPage` (`switch_tab`), `QueryEditorPage` (`switch_variable_tab`, `set_view_mode`, `switch_visualization_tab`, `add_filter`, `set_sort`), `DashboardEditorPage` (`confirm_add_card`, `update_card_content`, `save_filter`), `AddCardModal` (`select_card_type`), and `DropdownOptionsModal` (`change_option_source`). A malicious client could previously send an unknown string to raise `ArgumentError` and crash the LiveView process, enabling targeted denial-of-service against individual user sessions. Also removed the unused `Lotus.Web.Helpers.decode_params/1` helper, which had a wildcard `String.to_existing_atom/1` over arbitrary URL parameter keys

### Fixed

- **`SourcesMap.load_database/1` no longer silently swallows exceptions** - The bare `rescue _ -> nil` clause now logs a warning with the database name and the exception message before returning `nil`, so configuration errors, connection failures, and adapter issues are diagnosable instead of silently dropping a database from the explorer (#105)
- **N+1 query on the Queries page dashboards tab** - `QueriesPage` previously issued one `list_dashboard_cards` query per dashboard while preloading card counts. It now uses the new `Lotus.list_dashboards(preload: [:cards])` option, collapsing the load into a single query (#103)
- **Graceful error handling for JSON encoding failures** - Wrapped `Lotus.JSON.encode!` calls in `ResultsComponent`, `CardComponent`, and `VegaSpecBuilder` with safe encoding that renders user-friendly error messages instead of crashing the LiveView process when results contain non-encodable values (e.g. raw UUID binaries)
- **Raw database value normalization** - `VegaSpecBuilder` and `ResultsComponent` now use `Lotus.Normalizer` to normalize raw database values (UUID binaries, Dates, Decimals, etc.) before JSON encoding

## [0.14.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **CSP blocks TailwindPlus CDN script** - Added missing `nonce` attribute to the TailwindPlus CDN `<script>` tag in the root layout, which was blocked by `script-src-elem` CSP policies on browsers like Firefox

### Added

- **CSP nonce documentation** - Added Content Security Policy section to the installation guide covering nonce setup, required CSP directives, and an example plug

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **Dashboard chart rendering crash** - Added missing `handle_event/3` for `chart_render_error` in `CardComponent`, so JS chart errors are displayed gracefully instead of crashing the LiveView process
- **Incomplete visualization config crash** - `CardComponent` now uses `VegaSpecBuilder.valid_config?/1` to guard chart rendering, preventing specs with missing x/y fields from being sent to Vega-Lite
- **Chart data normalization** - `VegaSpecBuilder.transform_data` now normalizes `Decimal`, `NaiveDateTime`, `DateTime`, `Date`, and `Time` values to JSON-safe primitives before encoding, fixing "Invalid datetime format" errors in Vega-Lite
- **Use `Lotus.JSON` instead of `Jason` directly** - Replaced all `Jason.encode!` calls in `CardComponent` and `ResultsComponent` with `Lotus.JSON.encode!` for consistent JSON encoding

### Improved

- **Preserve chart fields across type switches** - Changing chart type in both the dashboard card settings and query editor now retains compatible fields (x_field, y_field, series_field, etc.) instead of resetting them

### Added

- **VegaSpecBuilder tests** - Comprehensive test coverage for all public functions: `valid_config?/1`, `build_config/1`, `build/2` across all 18 chart types, data normalization, and type inference

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-08

  - Intelligent visibility detection using IntersectionObserver scoped to parent container

### Internal

- Extracted floating results pill into dedicated `ResultsPillComponent` for better code organization and maintainability

## [0.6.2] - 2025-11-18

### Internal

- During build, ESBuild also generates a CSS, which was overriding the Tailwind CSS output, causing all the Tailwind classes to be lost. This has been fixed by updating the Tailwind args to output the CSS files to separate locations.
  - While ESBuild still outputs a CSS file, we don't use it because the Tailwind CSS output already contains all the CSS we need.

### Fixed

- Incorrect esbuild configuration was overriding the Tailwind CSS build output, causing missing styles in the published assets.

## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-18

### Internal

- Added a `release` mix task for use with new releases. `release` task ensures assets are always built before publishing.
- Changed tailwind config, removing `--watch=always` in `config.exs`, so that the `assets.build` task can be run without blocking.

### Fixed

- `assets.build` was not run for the 0.6.0 release, breaking the download functionality. 0.6.1 includes the built assets.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-14

### Changed

- Implement controller-based query export for chunking exports without creating a local temp file (#34):
  - Unsaved queries can no longer be exported; only saved queries can be exported. This was done to limit the token size in the URL and avoid exposing the data model (as the SQL query would need to be transmitted with the token).

- **INTERNAL:** Comprehensive Credo-based code quality improvements:
  - Added Credo static code analysis tool with custom configuration
  - Eliminated deeply nested functions by extracting helper functions across components
  - Reduced cyclomatic complexity in multiple modules (raised max to 10 for complex validation functions)
  - Improved predicate function naming conventions (e.g., `is_text_type?` → `text_type?`)
  - Refactored complex case statements and conditional logic for better readability
  - Added `@moduledoc false` annotations to internal modules
  - Configured selective exclusions for `MapJoin` warnings where pipe readability is prioritized
  - Enhanced code maintainability and testability without changing public APIs
